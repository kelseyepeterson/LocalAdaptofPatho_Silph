# LocalAdaptofPatho_Silph


MANUSCRIPT TITLE: Adaptation of pathogens to their local plant host, Silphium integrifolium, along a precipitation gradient

All figures and code were generated in RStudio 2022.02.3+492 "Prairie Trillium" Release. All packages needed to run the R code are shown in the RMD’s. 

#Code to generate figures and statistical analysis:
•	DVTindex_help.Rmd
    o	Code to generate figure 3
•	Figure5_PrairieVSCommonGarden
    o	Code to generate figure 5
•	PATHOFigs_for_Manu_FEB22.Rmd
    o	Code to generate figures 1, 2, 4
•	SUPP_Figure3_DimPathoEDIT.Rmd
    o	Code to generate supplementary figure 3 (fig S3)
•	STATSAnalysis_PathoDim2B.Rmd
    o	Code to generate all tables and statistical analysis in the manuscript

#Description of data files: 
•	2019and2020Prairie_data.txt
    o	This file contains data collected from the prairie sites in 2019 and 2020
•	Dim2b_latlon.csv
    o	The latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for the common garden sites and prairie sites as well as precipitation data
•	DVTINDEX_from_DVT.csv
    o	A separate file that contains the data that produced fig 3. This data file is sourced from SEPT2019_2020_COMPILED_2b_DATACOLL.txt
•	SEPT2019_2020_COMPILED_2b_DATACOLL.txt
•	SEPT2019_2020_COMPILED_2b_DATACOLL_plots.txt
•	SEPT2019_2020_COMPILED_2b_DATACOLL_plots_longversion.txt
    o	These 3 data files are different versions of the same raw data that was collected from the common garden sites in 2019 and 2020. The code calls for all 3 at different points to generate plots and run statistical analyses
•	Summary [ insert unique name here]
    o	Various data frames generated from r mark downs that contain summary statistics of the data. These are used to produce the figures in PATHOFigs_for_Manu_FEB22.Rmd graphs.
